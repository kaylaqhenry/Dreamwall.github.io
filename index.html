Welcome! DreamWall is a reimagined process on a semi-old idea. Vision boards are used to motivate people and are a source of daily encouragement, it boost moods, promotes emotional health, and lowers depression. DreamWall will make motivation and daily encouragement easy, less messy
    and personalized. Users will be able to pick as many characteristics or "dream" words.  You can download your dreamwall or refresh to get a new one and you can upload pictures you want in the board.
